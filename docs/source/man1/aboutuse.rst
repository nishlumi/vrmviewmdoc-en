#######################


You can use this app for free. Web apps often have the following statement:

* **No user registration required**.
* Free and ready to use!

There are many apps that appeal like this. However, you may need to register to use it. I'm not good with web apps like this. Web applications should be available as soon as they are accessed, just like old PC software. We developed this application with this in mind. (It can't be helped because it is necessary for marketing etc.)

* The web application version may have an operation delay depending on the server that operates. Of course, you also need an internet connection. If you want to use it stably in an environment without communication, we recommend using the PC version described later.

* The website "VRM Naval Base Portal" that publishes and links to this application uses Google Analytics to understand the number of accesses. note that.

This application itself does not have any functions to manage user information on the server or access external services to exchange data. For this reason, it is not possible to directly grasp the users, so if you can use it, I would be very happy if you could appeal that you are using it on each SNS.

Limitations
===================

Please read the explanation below carefully before using. Since the base Unity build is WebGL, it is more dependent on memory and graphics performance [1]_ than native apps on each OS. I can't stand animation production that is too long and uses a lot of 3D objects.

* Higher quality & beautiful photos!
* Longer and more versatile animations!

In these cases, it is recommended to use other apps that have released native versions of each OS.
For those who are familiar with it, it would be best to end up using the Unity editor or Blender.

.. [1] Shaders are particularly restricted. note that.
