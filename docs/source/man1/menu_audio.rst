There are buttons for functions related to BGM and SE.


:BGM, SE:
    Select the type of audio you want to work with.

:open:
    Open an audio file from your device. (Supported formats: ``mp3``, ``wav``)
:delete:
    Deletes the audio selected in the audio list.
:reproduction:
    Play audio.
:Stop:
    Stop audio.

:Audio list:
    Manage open audio files. You can preview the audio by selecting it.
:Seek bar:
    Specifies the position of the audio to play.

:Volume:
    Adjusts the volume of the selected audio.
:Audio status:
    Select how to register the selected audio in the animation project.

:pitch:
    Adjusts the pitch of the selected audio.

.. hint::
    Starting with ``ver 2.1.0``, you can also use the keyframe registration window displayed by right-clicking on other objects.
    **However, only audio can be registered while the audio tab is open** . 

    Basically, it is easier to understand and more convenient to use the ``Register keyframe`` button in the tab, but please use it properly.

.. note::
    * The playback/stop operation here is not reflected in the animation project. It's just a preview.
