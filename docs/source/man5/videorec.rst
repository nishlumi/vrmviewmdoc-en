With this application, you can shoot not only still images by screenshots, but also movies of the WebGL screen.

Of course, it can be used not only for each OS version but also for the web application version.

    When recording with this app, you can also record audio. In the future, we plan to support narration by voice synthesis. In general, it can also be used for the purpose of recording sound effects, etc. However, there may be times when you don't want to add sound unnecessarily because you don't have a microphone or you're not feeling well.

    In such a case, you can switch between activating and muting the audio by pressing this button.

|appvideo| Loads videos recorded with the app. The content will be rewritten each time you record, so save it if you want to see it forever.

|localvideo| Loads a video file on the device. Supported formats follow the specifications of the video element of each browser. Only ``.webm`` and ``.mp4`` can be opened as apps.


.. hint::
    You can also use the :doc:`./texttrack` feature described later.
